# Hi there! 👋

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building robust, scalable applications and creating seamless user experiences using cutting-edge technologies. My journey in tech is driven by an endless curiosity for innovation and a commitment to excellence.

## What I'm Currently Working On 🚀
I'm diving deep into the world of Next.js 14, working on a full-stack application built with tRPC that leverages its latest features. This experience is sharpening my skills in server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making me well-versed in the powerful capabilities of Next.js 14. My goal is to master every aspect of it to build faster, more efficient web applications.

## My Expertise 🛠️
### Frontend Frameworks
I have substantial experience with Angular and React, creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces that provide the best user experience.
### State Management
Proficient in managing application state using Redux Toolkit, which simplifies writing Redux logic and streamlines state management practices.
### GraphQL
Skilled in using Apollo GraphQL for data management both on the client and server side, enabling efficient, declarative data fetching that enhances the performance of web applications.
### Testing
I am adept at ensuring the reliability and robustness of applications through testing with Jest and Cypress, covering unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to maintain high-quality code.
### Backend and More
Proficient in using Node.js libraries like Express and koa, together with database ORMs such as Mongoose and Sequelize.

## Continuous Learning 🌱
I'm on a path of continuous improvement, currently expanding my knowledge in AWS to leverage cloud services for scalable, reliable, and secure applications. Understanding services like Amazon EC2, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, I aim to build cloud-native solutions that are both powerful and efficient.

## Collaboration and Community 👯
I'm eager to collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals on projects that challenge us to grow and innovate. I believe in the power of teamwork and shared knowledge to achieve remarkable results.
